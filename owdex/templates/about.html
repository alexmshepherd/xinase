    <h2>What is Owdex?</h2>
    <p>
        Owdex is an open index of pages from across the web. Instead of crawling through
        hypertext based on links, it only indexes pages that its users direct it to.
        Owdex aims to build a better alternative to web search by cutting through the
        cruft of junk results and bringing focus to real information.
