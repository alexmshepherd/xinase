First of all, thank you for getting this far! 
It means a lot to me that you're interested in this project and willing to help out. 
Given that not enough work has been done yet for the project to gain momentum in what I feel is the right direction, 
development of Owdex's core functionality will probably be done by me for now, until the essentials are complete. 
However, the Issues tab may list a number of smaller changes that should be made eventually but are neither critical nor part of the system's core abilities. 
If you feel like taking one of them on, I'd love to work with you.
